CREDITS:
This application was developed by Seth Lakstins, Luke Ferderer, and Michael Kuznicki for Data Structures and Algorithms(CSSE230) at RHIT.

DESCRIPTION:
To launch the application, clone the repository and launch main.

It can be used to determine the best path for a student's schedule given the classrooms in the order that the student will attend them.

Also included is a classroom/node editor, which can be used to add on to the map if the user has a nonconventional path that they prefer to take.

CONTROLS for the node editor:
	Click a node to select it.
	Click empty space to create and select a new node.
	Enter the name of the node in the textbox that appears if it is a classroom. If it is a path node, leave as TBD. To stop editing a node's name, press ENTER.
	To connect two nodes, select them both and press E.
	To set a path as not Wheel Chair Accessible(WCA), select the nodes connected by the path and press W.
	To set a path as outside, do the same but press O.
	To save changes to the locally stored map, press S.

TIPS:
Routes can be saved and loaded by name using the buttons on the left. 
Zooming can be done with the buttons on the lower right or with the scroll wheel.
Panning can be done with the arrow keys.
Different floors can be selected with the upper right buttons.
